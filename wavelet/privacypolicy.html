                            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your <strong>email address</strong> for authentication purposes. This is handled securely via Supabase Auth.</li>
                            <li><strong>Audio Recordings:</strong> The core function of Wavelet is to create audio journals. We collect and store the <strong>audio files</strong> you record within the app.</li>
                            <li><strong>Journal Metadata:</strong> You may voluntarily add titles to your recordings. This information is stored alongside your audio.</li>
