            <p>Trying your hardest is scary. Whether it's in creation, in sport, in anything. You openly admit that this is the best you can do. You show the world your ceiling. Your actual worth. Measured. Visible. Final. And the world looks. And the world judges.</p>

            <p>It's scary to care. Caring about something means admitting what matters to you. Your values, exposed. Caring deeply is worse. You tie your very being to something. Something that can fail. Something that can be mocked. Something that can be wrong.</p>

            <p>Better to say I didn't try. Better to say I never cared. Better to die in indifference than to be found wanting.</p>

            <p>So?</p>

            <p>i will be goop. Amorphous, vacuous, apathetic, goop. Create something of value? Care about something? Try? Not for me. I'm goop. I will not move. I will not speak. I will be goop. When prompted for my thoughts, I'll bubble and ooz. When asked to create, I'll ploop. When pushed to try, I'll simply spread thinner. Anything to avoid making impact. Anything to avoid leaving evidence. Minimizing my delta on the world. Minimizing the amount of content the world will have against me. No form. No edges. I have won. I will be goop. I will</p>
