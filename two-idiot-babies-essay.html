            <p>The sun dipped below the horizon, casting dusk over the city. The streets filled as people left work. Herds of office workers and construction crews algorithmically routed themselves through the evening. Amongst them, a husband and wife walked in silence into their apartment.</p>

            <p>Their TV illuminated the dark, musty living room. The family of four cramped onto the tiny couch, eating dinner and watching television. It was a modest family; the father worked as a construction worker, the mother a waitress. The light from the antiquated TV danced on the dark bags under both their eyes. On either side of the couple sat energized Phil and Tommy, ages 7 and 5 respectively.</p>

            <p>Phil loved dinosaurs and trains. He loved to draw and liked sports which involve kicking. Tommy also loved dinosaurs and trains. He also loved to draw, and he liked watching his brother play sports which involve kicking. The boys almost never get to see their parents, and every time they do their parents only seem uninterested and tired at best. So every night, they try to get their parents' attention the only way they know how.</p>

            <p>Thud. Thud. Thud.</p>

            <p>Phil continuously slapped his dad on his bald head.</p>

            <p>Thud. Thud. Thud.</p>

            <p>Tommy continuously kicked his mom on her arm.</p>

            <p>The two children laughed hysterically.</p>

            <p>Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud.</p>

            <p>The hitting had begun as frustration, but at this point it had morphed into an ongoing joke. The parents simply sat and endured this. Repeated efforts of lecturing and punishment and bribes and persuasion were all ineffective. The TV droned on for hours, until it was time for bedtime. Mom and Dad led Phil and Tommy to their separate rooms for bed. Dad tucked Phil into bed. It was storytime, the one part of the night the kids looked forward to the most.</p>

            <p>Phil looked up at Dad expectantly, ready for a story. He simply could not wait. The two sat in silence for a while. Phil's excitement began to falter. Finally, Dad spoke, but it wasn't to tell a story.</p>

            <p>"What's your favorite color again?" asked Dad.</p>

            <p>"Uh, blue! It's the color of the sky." Phil said with a smile on his face.</p>

            <p>"That's good, that's good. I knew you were a smart boy. That is objectively the best color." said Dad.</p>

            <p>"What does objectively mean?" Phil asked, horribly mispronouncing objectively.</p>

            <p>"That just means it's the right answer. According to science, it is scientifically the best color. And that's according to science. Don't let anyone tell you anything different."</p>

            <p>"Oh okay!" Phil enthused. He didn't question anything about the science of the claims, or the validity of the claims at all. He was just happy that his color was the best color. Dad left the room, and Phil slept content, basking in the fact that he was lucky enough to have chosen the best color to be his favorite color.</p>

            <p>The next day came and went, and the family found itself on the couch for dinner again. Dad had just returned from work and his clothes were covered in dirt. Mom had just returned from the dinner shift, exhausted and tired. They both slouched on the couch, too tired to do anything but watch the TV. The TV droned on. The children didn't understand anything that the man on the TV was saying, so inherently they got bored. The thuds resumed.</p>

            <p>Thud. Thud. Thud.</p>

            <p>Hysterical laughter ensued and faded out.</p>

            <p>Thud. Thud. Thud.</p>

            <p>Hysterical laughter ensued and faded out.</p>

            <p>Hours passed, and it was bedtime again. Mom led Tommy into his room and got him ready for bed. All tucked in, Tommy didn't know what to prepare for. He was used to stories, but last night Mom decided to talk about colors, which was weird. Time passed, and Mom spoke.</p>

            <p>"What are your thoughts on dinosaurs?" Mom asked.</p>

            <p>Tommy grinned. This is good, he knew a lot about dinosaurs, he could contribute to this discussion.</p>

            <p>"They are freaking awesome," Tommy said, "I can't wait to see one one day."</p>

            <p>"OK", said Mom, brushing past the fact that Tommy doesn't know they're extinct, "What would you say is the best dinosaur?".</p>

            <p>"Hmmm." Tommy tapped his finger against his chin cartoonishly. "I'm not sure I've thought about that. I like all of them".</p>

            <p>"Is it not the T. rex?" Mom asked naturally.</p>

            <p>"I mean, yeah, maybe, T. rexes are cool," Tommy replied, a little self-conscious now.</p>

            <p>"Everyone who knows that the best color is red, intelligent people like us, they all love the T. rex. It's just how it works. It's definitely the coolest one."</p>

            <p>"Really? Is that how it works?"</p>

            <p>"Of course, unless you aren't truly a supporter of the color red."</p>

            <p>"Of course I am! Red is objectively the best one!" Tommy exclaimed. "Now that I think about it, the T. rex has a really cool head."</p>

            <p>"And tail." Mom said, sincerely.</p>

            <p>"Yea and tail."</p>

            <p>The two shared a laugh.</p>

            <p>"Now," Mom said, recollecting herself and lowering her voice to a serious tone, "You know what the worst dinosaur is?"</p>

            <p>"Is it…"</p>

            <p>"The pterodactyl. That one is just the worst."</p>

            <p>"Oh!"</p>

            <p>"And it's not even just the pterodactyl itself, people who think that the pterodactyl is the best dinosaur are just insufferable and a million, trillion times worse," Mom emphasized.</p>

            <p>"Oh okay."</p>

            <p>"They boast and brag and they're just so cocky about their opinions even though we know they have no idea what they're talking about," Mom concluded.</p>

            <p>"Hm."</p>

            <p>The conversation ended at that. Mom left the room, leaving Tommy alone in bed, left alone in his bed to absorb all of the information which had just been thrown at him. He shuffled in bed, unable to sleep.</p>

            <p>Perhaps he had been left with too much to think about, so he got up to go use the bathroom. On the way back, he passed Phil's room and saw Dad talking to him. He couldn't believe what he was hearing. He overheard Dad talk about how great the pterodactyl was, and how it was so cool because it could fly.</p>

            <p>What an idiot, Tommy thought. He's so full of it, just like Mom said. I can't believe Phil is just listening to this stuff. I never want to get my bedtime stories from Dad. Only from Mom.</p>

            <p>He went back to his room, with his ideas reinforced.</p>

            <p>The next day came and went, and the family found itself on the couch for dinner again. The man on the TV went on about current events and boring words and other countries which the kids had never heard of, much less cared about.</p>

            <p>Tonight, however, there was no thudding. Tommy glared at Phil, unable to fathom how he could possibly think the pterodactyl was even remotely comparable to the great T. rex. Looking at him and just knowing that he thought that made him angry. Tommy glared at Phil across the couch. His brother sat there, smug, probably thinking about that stupid pterodactyl right now. Probably thinking he was so smart for liking the flying one. Tommy's jaw clenched. How could Phil be so wrong about something so obvious?</p>

            <p>Thud.</p>

            <p>Phil slapped Dad's bald head.</p>

            <p>Tommy felt a laugh escape before he could stop it. Phil looked over at him, grinning, waiting. Tommy had forgotten how funny his brother was.</p>

            <p>Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud.</p>

            <p>Bed time came swiftly after. Mom and Dad walked Tommy and Phil to their bedrooms. Dad lifted Phil into his bed and pulled the blanket over him tightly. Phil now looked forward to these discussions. He knew that he already had all of these thoughts in his head, it just helped for someone to vocalize them for him.</p>

            <p>Dad sat at the foot of the bed and looked at Phil.</p>

            <p>"Phil."</p>

            <p>"Yes Dad?"</p>

            <p>"You're happy you're in second grade right."</p>

            <p>"Yes I am! We're learning about bar graphs."</p>

            <p>"That's very smart, pal. Good for you. You need to be proud that you're a second grader, you second graders have to stick together."</p>

            <p>"Yea I know. It's not like we're in first grade any more." Phil said.</p>

            <p>"That's a great point. Or even worse," Dad leaned in closer to Phil, "kindergarteners."</p>

            <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

            <p>"I mean, those kids can't be up to any good. They're definitely jealous of you second graders because you're ranked so much higher than them. They want that status, they want that glory." Dad said, gradually getting more and more impassioned. "They want the thrill that comes alongside being in the big 2-G. They want to be you."</p>

            <p>"Oh no."</p>

            <p>"You want to hear what I think they're up to? I think they're all scheming. Every single kindergartener. Every single one of them is a rat. A dirty rat." declared Dad, who was now standing and waving his hands around erratically. "Every single one of them. They want to be you, Phil. You need to feel threatened. You be too off guard around these kindergartners and they'll take your second grade position from you. They're selfish, Phil. They don't care about you. None of them."</p>

            <p>"Noooo. That's so scary," said Phil. He had never seen his Dad so passionate about anything. The passion in itself was enough to convince Phil that all kindergartners were out to get him. Plus, he was his Dad, and that status was enough for him.</p>

            <p>"I need to be more careful!" Phil said.</p>

            <p>"Yes, I suppose you do," Dad said as he got up to leave. He was almost out the door before Phil was suddenly struck with a piece of knowledge like a truck.</p>

            <p>"Wait! But isn't Tommy a kindergartner?" Phil exclaimed, shocked at this revelation.</p>

            <p>Dad stopped in his tracks, turned around, and put his hands on top of his head, mouth agape. "Oh. My. God, I haven't thought about it like that."</p>

            <p>Phil felt sick to his gut. He never would've thought Tommy would be such an awful person. He also never would've guessed that he was so jealous of him, given that he had known Tommy for literally his entire life. But it seemed people changed. It was hard to sleep knowing this information. But he still tried.</p>

            <p>The next day came and went.</p>

            <p>Tonight, however, Tommy and Phil were left in the living room by themselves. Tommy glared at Phil, thinking about how misguided his opinions on dinosaurs were, and the audacity to even be so smugly and boastfully wrong. Phil sat in an upright position, his fists clenched, preparing himself for the moment Tommy tried to take his second grader position from him. Animosity seeped through the children and drowned the room. The room was deadly silent aside from the man on the TV. He spoke, but the children didn't listen. They only knew how they felt.</p>

            <p>Thud. Thud. Thud.</p>

            <p>Phil could feel his own heartbeat pounding through his chest, he could hear it in his ears, his hands, his toes.</p>

            <p>Thud. Thud. Thud.</p>

            <p>Every sound in the room was drowned out by the overwhelming boom of Tommy's heartbeat. His eyesight went hazy. Every thump of his heart pumped more hatred into his body. He could hear nor see anything but his own anger.</p>

            <p>Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud.</p>

            <p>Tommy lunged first. Phil punched him in the mouth. Teeth scattered across the carpet. Tommy bit into Phil's leg. Phil screamed. They rolled across the floor, hitting and clawing. Blood from Tommy's mouth smeared across Phil's face, across the couch, across the pale carpet their mother had just cleaned.</p>

            <p>The TV continued behind them. The news anchor discussed economic policy. Neither boy heard him. They didn't hear anything. There were no colors anymore, no dinosaurs, no grades. Just the other person who needed to be hurt.</p>

            <p>Phil's fist connected with Tommy's nose. Tommy's fingernails tore at Phil's arms. The room filled with the wet sounds of impact, of breathing, of small bodies colliding with furniture.</p>

            <p>Eventually, they stopped moving.</p>

            <p>The parents heard none of this. They had retreated to their room, laid on the bed side by side, finally at peace. With the children distracted, they could finally relax.</p>

            <p>"So gullible," Dad said.</p>

            <p>Mom nodded. "You think they'll be okay though?"</p>

            <p>"They're kids. They'll figure it out."</p>

            <p>He turned on the TV. A man appeared on screen, sitting behind a desk. He gestured emphatically. Mom and Dad watched in silence, nodding occasionally.</p>
