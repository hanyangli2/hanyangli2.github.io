                    anonymous connection app that allows users to privately select contacts from their address book, discovering mutual connections between two people without premature disclosure of identities.

                <p class="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed">
                    the premise of exeno is to facilitate connections between individuals who have a pre-existing, real-world relationship. a user can privately select a contact from their own address book. identities are only revealed to both parties if a mutual selection is made, resulting in a "match."

                    <li>anonymous selections: make a selection from your contact list without revealing your identity</li>
                    <li>contact list integration: the app securely reads the device's contact list to enable users to make their selections</li>
                    <li>mutual match reveals: identities are only revealed when two users have mutually selected each other</li>
                    <li>secure backend: built on supabase for robust user authentication, data storage, and serverless functions</li>
                    <li>user-initiated sms invitations: to notify a contact that they have been selected, the app facilitates sending a one-time sms invitation</li>

                    <li>user confirms action: the user must affirmatively tap "confirm" to authorize the sending of the sms</li>
                    <li>one-time invitation sent: a single, anonymous sms is sent to the recipient</li>
